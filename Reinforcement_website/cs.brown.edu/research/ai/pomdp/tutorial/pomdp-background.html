<P>
We assume that the reader is familiar with the value iteration
algorithm for regular discrete Markov decision processes
(<tt>MDP</tt>s). However, we will need to differentiate these from
<tt>POMDP</tt>s which we could also call a discrete Markov decision
process.  Therefore, we will refer to the more familiar <tt>MDP</tt>s
as <tt>CO-MDP</tt>s, emphasizing that they are completely
observable. <p>

Adding partial observability to an <tt>MDP</tt> is not a trivial
addition.  Solution procedures for <tt>CO-MDP</tt>s give values or
policies for each state.  Use of these solutions requires the state to
be completely known at all times and with complete observability this
presents no problem.  Partial observability clouds the idea of the
current state.  No longer is there certainty about the current state
which makes selecting actions based on the current state (as in a
<tt>CO-MDP</tt>) no longer valid.  <p>

A <tt>POMDP</tt> is really just an <tt>MDP</tt>; we have a set of
states, a set of actions, transitions and immediate rewards.  The
actions' effects on the state in a <tt>POMDP</tt> is exactly the same
as in an <tt>MDP</tt>.  The only difference is in whether or not we
can observe the current state of the process.  In a <tt>POMDP</tt> we
add a set of observations to the model.  So instead of directly
observing the current state, the state gives us an observation which
provides a hint about what state it is in.  The observations can be
probabilistic; so we need to also specify the observation model.  This
observation model simply tells us the probability of each observation
for each state in the model.<p>

Although the underlying dynamics of the <tt>POMDP</tt> are still
Markovian, since we have no direct access to the current state, our
decisions require keeping track of (possibly) the entire history of
the process, making this a non-Markovian process.  The history at a
given point in time is comprised of our knowledge about our starting
situation, all actions performed and all observations seen.  <p>

Fortunately, it turns out that simply maintaining a probability
distribution over all of the states provides us with the same
information as if we maintained the complete history. In a
<tt>CO-MDP</tt> we track our current state and update it after each
action.  Here this is trivial, because it is completely observable.
In a <tt>POMDP</tt> we have to maintain this probability distribution
over states.  When we perform and action and make an observation, we
have to update the distribution.  Updating the distribution is very
easy and just involves using the transition and observation
probabilities. You'll have to take our word for this, since we are
prohibited from showing you the formula.
